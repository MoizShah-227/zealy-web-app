        <p className='text-left'>We've listened to your feedback and made a wave of upgrades to our invite system. Say goodbye to the one-quest limit. With our new system, you get to define the XP needed for an invite to count, giving you more control and ensuring quality over quantity.</p>
        <br/>
        <p className='text-left'>Ever wondered about the status of your invites or wanted to see the users someone has invited? Now, you can inspect all invites directly from a user's profile, and easily distinguish between those that have been counted, not counted, or even consumed.</p>
        <br/>

        <p className='text-left'>And here's the best part - our new system is fully compatible with recurring quests! Now, claiming will consume the invite, paving the way for seamless recurring quests. Dive into the world of our improved invites system and experience quality, clarity, and control like never before.
